# Exercises: Sign / Verify Messages using ECDSA and the NIST P-521 Curve

In this exercise we shall **sign** and **verify** messages using the **ECDSA** digital signature algorithm and the NIST **P-521** curve.

## Sign a Message with ECDSA / P-521

Write a program to sign a **message** by given **private key**. The message is given as text and the private key is given as hex string \(130-132 hex digits\). Use the **ECDSA deterministic signing** \(following [RFC 6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979)\) and the curve NIST **P-521**, which also known as **secp521r1**.
